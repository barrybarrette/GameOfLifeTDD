# Game Of Life TDD Demo
Conway's Game Of Life TDD demo project

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to implement [Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using test-driven development.

Instructions:
- Check out the project
- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm test`. This starts mocha and watches for changes. Alternatively, use your IDE's built in test runner.
- Implement the rules of the game as outlined in `js/game.js` using test-driven development.
- To run the simulation and validate your work, run `npm start`. This starts the app in a watch mode that will reload on file changes.
- While the game is stopped you can click any cell to toggle it. Hit the start button to begin the simulation.

## Good luck!
